# Binary Calculator Simulation

A circuit simulator that visualizes binary calculations with LED matrices.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Naresh-x86/Binary-Calculator-Simulation.git
   cd Binary-Calculator-Simulation
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Controls

- Use arrow keys to navigate the circuit board
- Click buttons to perform binary operations
- LEDs display the current state of calculations
